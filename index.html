			<p><b>What's this all about?</b>  In collaboration with the City of Peterborough, we built an interactive web map that shows solar potential of building rooftops in Peterborough so that public and private property owners can determine if solar panel installations are a viable solution for their buildings. 
			</p>
			<p><b>How did we do this?</b>  The solar potential layer was created using Solar Radiation tools in ArcGIS Pro and is based on a high-resolution Digital Surface Model (DSM) created from lidar point data. The web application was developed using Experience Builder - one of Esri's latest configurable apps available through ArcGIS Online - and allows users to find their building on a map and display the solar potential values in a customised pop-up display.
			</p>
			<p><b>Why is this application relevant?</b>  This application stands out from other solar potential maps of Peterborough by providing localised estimates of solar radiation produced from high resolution lidar data and local weather patterns and conditions. It is an accessible and easy to use application that will help encourage the use of rooftop solar panels in the city.

			<h2 class="line">Solar Potential Layer</h2>
			<img src="images/poster_methods.png" alt="Methodology" width="100%"> 
			<p>Modeling solar potential of city rooftops with relatively high accuracy was possible due to the availability of high resolution lidar point data provided by the City of Peterborough. The lidar data allowed us to create a detailed Digital Surface Model (DSM) for modeling the influence of rooftop structures and nearby obstructions on the total amount of solar radiation received by a building. Due to the very high resolution of the DSM (30cm), the processing time of the Area Solar Radiation tool in ArcGIS Pro was increased significantly and it was necessary to split the DSM up into smaller subsections to run simultaneously on three separate computers. Overall, the analysis took close to two weeks to complete.</p>
			
			<img src="images/processingTime_white.png" alt="Processing Time" width="100%" class="ProcessTime"> 
			
			<p>The resulting solar layer is displayed below, symbolised as Usable Solar Radiation and Electricity Production per year. The large (and often taller), flat-roofed buildings characteristic of the central downtown area show some of the highest potentials. There is also a trend toward higher solar radiation on the periphery neighbourhoods of the city. These neighbourhoods are often newer developments with a reduced tree canopy. </p>

			<p>Based on the analysis, the City of Peterborough can potentially produce 625,839,160 kWh of electricity per year from rooftop solar power. This equates to a reduction of about 25,034 tonnes of CO2 per year, which is more than enough to meet the City's Climate Change Strategy to reduce emissions by making current buildings more energy efficient (check out Peterborough's Climate Change Action Plan <a href="https://www.peterborough.ca/en/city-hall/resources/Documents/Chapter-1-City-of-Peterborough-Climate-Action-Plans-FINAL.pdf">here</a>).</p>

			<p>Large buildings are noticeable outliers and produce the highest potentials. When the top 179 buildings with highest solar potential were removed from the analysis, the average rooftop solar potential dropped from 24,000 to 18,000 kWh. Despite this, buildings in Peterborough do on average have the potential to meet their electricity consumption (i.e., 6,920 kWh base electricity use per year; Parekh and Wang 2012) by installing solar panels.</p>
