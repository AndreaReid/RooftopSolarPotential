			<p><b>What's this all about?</b> In collaboration with the City of Peterborough, we built an interactive web map that shows solar potential of building rooftops in Peterborough so that public and private property owners can determine if solar panel installations are a viable solution for their buildings. 
			</p>
			<p><b>Why is this application relevant?</b> This application stands out from other solar potential maps by providing localised estimates of solar radiation produced from high resolution lidar data and local weather patterns and conditions. It is an accessible and easy to use application that will help encourage the use of rooftop solar panels in the city.

			<h2 class="line">Solar Potential Layer</h2>
			<p>Modeling solar potential of city rooftops with relatively high accuracy was possible due to the availability of high resolution lidar point data provided by the City of Peterborough. The lidar data allowed us to create a detailed Digital Surface Model (DSM) for modeling the influence of rooftop structures and nearby obstructions on the total amount of solar radiation received by a building. </p>
			
			<p>The resulting solar layer is displayed below, symbolised at Usable Solar Radiation and Electricity Production per year. As expected, the large (and often taller), flat-roofed buildings characteristic of the central downtown area show some of the highest potentials. There is also a trend toward higher solar radiation on the periphery neighbourhoods of the city. These neighbourhoods are often newer developments and likely have a reduced tree canopy that would increase the viewshed (thus increasing total sun hours) of buildings in those areas. </p>

			<p>Based on the analysis, the City of Peterborough can potentially produce 625,839,160 kWh of electricity per year from rooftop solar power. This equates to a reduction of about 25,033.57 tonnes of CO2 per year.</p>

			<p>When large building outliers were removed from the statistical analysis, the maximum rooftop solar potential dropped significantly. This suggests that a small proportion of buildings (less than 1%) are responsible for a large proportion of the city's solar potential. Despite this , buildings in Peterborough do on average have the potential to meet their electricity consumption through rooftop solar power. The average household in Canada consumes about 6,920 kWh per year for base electricity use (Parekh and Wang 2012). The average potential electricity production modeled for rooftops in Peterborough without considering large outlier buildings is 18 MWh (18,000 kWh) per year, more than double the base electricity use for an average household.</p>
